please note that the writeup is located in doc/ and named:

Files
---------
Input.java: Main driver class and holds the code that will:
read user's input for map file and search function
search functions BFS, DFS, A*.
print results of searches.
Node.java: Node elements that store each node on the maps'
information from coordinates to character value (depending on if
it's comma or period, etc) and other necessary values for any
of the search functions.

To run the program
-------------------
cd to the src/ directory and use the "make" command before
using the "make run" command. The user will then be prompted
for the map (please enter in the *.txt file name; e.g. map1.txt).

Runtimes
---------
The search functions generally run .05-.08 seconds, but have run
when given map6 for 18s (BFS), 32(DFS), 19(A*).

Reflections
------------
I took over 15 hours on this assignment. I started off with about an
hour a day for the first week, but the second week, I had to put in
drastically more time since debugging was difficult since I had not
thought out my algorithms well the first time. I had fun discussing
the algorithm with friends, though, so I was able to finish in time.
